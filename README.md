AgentSim
========

### Requirements
* Java 7 or higher
* maven, only tested with version 3

### How to run on Linux
* Execute `install.sh` to compile the program
* Execute `run.sh` to execute the program after compilation

### Goal
Simulate a small goblin population in a cave. The population should slowly build up and produce resources.

### Understanding the code
If you want to read the code, you should start with the [AgentSim](https://github.com/ISibboI/AgentSim/blob/master/src/main/java/de/isibboi/agentsim/AgentSim.java) class. It contains the main method.
Of course, I should add some more information here, but I probably won't until someone requests it.
